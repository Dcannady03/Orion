# Orion Architecture

Orion is organized around a small core, a shared Service Registry, explicit services, and capability-focused skills.

## Dependency flow

`Orion Core -> Service Registry -> Services/Skills -> Providers`

The core initializes shared components. Consumers discover them through the registry rather than globals.

## Memory layers

- **Session Memory** is temporary and process-local.
- **Project Context** is persistent and stored inside the active workspace's `.orion/` directory.
- Future **Conversation Context** will manage references and interaction history without mixing those responsibilities.

## Project Context files

- `project.json` — project identity, phase, goal, model, and timestamps
- `history.json` — append-only project event timeline
- `tasks.json` — Task Manager storage foundation
- `notes.md` — human-readable timestamped notes
- `metrics.json` — derived project counts
- `settings.json` — future project-specific preferences

Workspace changes rebind Project Context so each project keeps independent, portable data.


## Workspace Search

`SearchSkill` is registered by the built-in Search Plugin. It depends only on the Workspace Manager, which guarantees that all searched paths remain inside the active workspace. Search remains read-only and applies resource limits before reading files.
