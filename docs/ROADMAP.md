## Current Release

**v0.5.7.1 — Forge: COMPLETE**

Forge now carries one validated execution-engine snapshot from command preflight into
Codex Bridge, removing duplicate detection while preserving immutable approval and
workspace boundaries.

**Active milestone:** Review Gate and Workflow Engine Phase 1. Cross-platform
diagnostics through `orion doctor` remains planned after the AI Team orchestration
foundation.

## v0.5.7.1 — Execution Engine Handoff ✅

- [x] `team implement` resolves its implementation engine exactly once
- [x] The validated engine and executable path are handed directly to Codex Bridge
- [x] Direct bridge callers retain one safe pre-claim engine check
- [x] Pass-then-fail duplicate-probe behavior is covered by regression tests
- [x] Immutable approvals, workspace binding, and single-use claims remain unchanged

## v0.5.7 — Codex Bridge Phase 1 ✅

- [x] Explicit approval binds an immutable AI Team plan SHA-256 and workspace
- [x] Each approval is external, immutable, explicit by ID, and single-use
- [x] Local `codex exec` is confined to the active Git workspace root
- [x] Network, web search, extra roots, MCP, apps, hooks, plugins, and sub-agents are disabled
- [x] Git metadata and all branch, commit, push, merge, tag, and PR actions remain blocked
- [x] Strict implementation and test results persist under `~/.orion/codex/`
- [x] Successful execution stops at `Awaiting Review`
- [x] CLI exposes `team approve`, `team implement`, and `team run`
- [x] `execution status` distinguishes desktop apps, runnable CLIs, and Python readiness
- [x] One shared resolver launches the exact Codex executable reported by discovery
- [x] Missing engines are explained before an immutable approval is consumed

## v0.5.6 — Task Manager Phase 1 ✅

- [x] Strict first-class tasks under workspace-local `.orion/tasks.json`
- [x] Explicit proposed, ready, terminal, and future workflow states
- [x] Approval and cancellation remain direct user decisions
- [x] Dependencies reject missing references, duplicates, self-reference, and cycles
- [x] AI Team plans link as artifacts without automatic execution
- [x] Append-only task events support later workflow and streaming consumers
- [x] CLI exposes create, list, show, approve, cancel, events, and link-plan commands
- [x] Workspace rebinding keeps project task stores isolated

## Next — Review Gate and Workflow Engine Phase 1

- [ ] Start only from an explicitly approved Task Manager task
- [ ] Link the project task, approved AI Team plan, and Codex run identities
- [ ] Move through bounded Architect → Engineer → Awaiting Review stages
- [ ] Record bridge transitions in the existing task event stream
- [ ] Add a read-only Reviewer that consumes the persisted run and workspace diff
- [ ] Require another explicit decision before any repair pass
- [ ] Keep commits, pushes, merges, tags, and pull requests disabled

## v0.5.5 — Agent Registry Phase 1 ✅

- [x] Strict YAML definitions under external user data at `~/.orion/agents/`
- [x] Provider, model, instructions, declared tools, limits, and permissions
- [x] List, show, guided create, enable, disable, and bounded test commands
- [x] Built-in Agent files are seeded once without overwriting user changes
- [x] AI Team roles resolve to assigned configurable agents
- [x] Phase 1 grants no tools and performs no file, shell, or Git actions
- [ ] Phase 2: explicitly approved read-only tool dispatch

## v0.5.5 — AI Team Phase 1 ✅

- [x] Architect role produces a structured implementation plan
- [x] Engineer role reviews the Architect artifact and consolidates the final plan
- [x] Team tasks persist outside the application under `~/.orion/team/tasks/`
- [x] CLI exposes `team`, `team roles`, `team plan`, and `team status`
- [x] Token estimates and configurable cost estimates are displayed
- [x] Planning stops at `Awaiting Approval` with no implementation or PR actions
- [x] Phase 2: approval-bound `team implement <task-id> <approval-id>` with structured artifacts
- [ ] Phase 3: read-only reviewer and explicit repair approval

## v0.3.6.1 — Constellation ✅

- Multi-provider calendar support
